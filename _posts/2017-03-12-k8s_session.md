# K8S Architecture

A running Kubernetes cluster contains node agents (`kubelet`) and master
components (APIs, scheduler, etc), on top of a distributed storage solution.
This diagram shows our desired eventual state, though we're still working on a
few things, like making `kubelet` itself (all our components, really) run within
containers, and making the scheduler 100% pluggable.

## The Kubernetes Control Plane

The Kubernetes control plane is split into a set of components. Currently they
all run on a single _master_ node, but that is expected to change soon in order
to support high-availability clusters. These components work together to provide
a unified view of the cluster.

### `etcd`

All persistent master state is stored in an instance of `etcd`. This provides a
great way to store configuration data reliably. With `watch` support,
coordinating components can be notified very quickly of changes.

### Kubernetes API Server

The apiserver serves up the [Kubernetes API](../api.md). It is intended to be a
CRUD-y server, with most/all business logic implemented in separate components
or in plug-ins. It mainly processes REST operations, validates them, and updates
the corresponding objects in `etcd` (and eventually other stores).

### Scheduler

The scheduler binds unscheduled pods to nodes via the `/binding` API. The
scheduler is pluggable, and we expect to support multiple cluster schedulers and
even user-provided schedulers in the future.

### Kubernetes Controller Manager Server

All other cluster-level functions are currently performed by the Controller
Manager. For instance, `Endpoints` objects are created and updated by the
endpoints controller, and nodes are discovered, managed, and monitored by the
node controller. These could eventually be split into separate components to
make them independently pluggable.

The [`replicationcontroller`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/replication-controller.md) is a
mechanism that is layered on top of the simple [`pod`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods.md)
API. We eventually plan to port it to a generic plug-in mechanism, once one is
implemented.

## The Kubernetes Node

When looking at the architecture of the system, we'll break it down to services
that run on the worker node and services that compose the cluster-level control
plane.

The Kubernetes node has the services necessary to run application containers and
be managed from the master systems.

Each node runs Docker, of course.  Docker takes care of the details of
downloading images and running containers.

### `kubelet`

The `kubelet` manages [pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods.md) and their containers, their
images, their volumes, etc.

### `kube-proxy`

Each node also runs a simple network proxy and load balancer (see the
[services FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/wiki/Services-FAQ) for
more details). This reflects `services` (see
[the services  doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services.md) for more details) as defined in
the Kubernetes API on each node and can do simple TCP and UDP stream forwarding
(round robin) across a set of backends.

Service endpoints are currently found via [DNS](../admin/dns.md) or through
environment variables (both
[Docker-links-compatible](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/) and
Kubernetes `{FOO}_SERVICE_HOST` and `{FOO}_SERVICE_PORT` variables are
supported). These variables resolve to ports managed by the service proxy.

# Core concepts

## Pods

A pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers), the shared storage for those containers, and options about how to run the containers. Pods are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A pod models an application-specific "logical host" - it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled &mdash; in a pre-container world, they would have executed on the same physical or virtual machine.


## Labels and Selectors
_Labels_ are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods.
Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users, but which do not directly imply semantics to the core system.
Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of objects.  Labels can be attached to objects at creation time and subsequently added and modified at any time.
Each object can have a set of key/value labels defined.  Each Key must be unique for a given object.

```json
"labels": {
  "key1" : "value1",
  "key2" : "value2"
}
```

We'll eventually index and reverse-index labels for efficient queries and watches, use them to sort and group in UIs and CLIs, etc. We don't want to pollute labels with non-identifying, especially large and/or structured, data. Non-identifying information should be recorded using [annotations](/docs/user-guide/annotations).

Example labels:

   * `"release" : "stable"`, `"release" : "canary"`
   * `"environment" : "dev"`, `"environment" : "qa"`, `"environment" : "production"`
   * `"tier" : "frontend"`, `"tier" : "backend"`, `"tier" : "cache"`
   * `"partition" : "customerA"`, `"partition" : "customerB"`
   * `"track" : "daily"`, `"track" : "weekly"`

These are just examples; you are free to develop your own conventions.

### Selectors
The API currently supports two types of selectors: equality-based and set-based.
```shell
$ kubectl get pods -l environment=production,tier=frontend
```
or using _set-based_ requirements:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (production, qa),tier in (frontend)'
```


## Services
A Kubernetes `Service` is an abstraction which defines a logical set of `Pods`
and a policy by which to access them - sometimes called a micro-service.  The
set of `Pods` targeted by a `Service` is (usually) determined by a [`Label
Selector`](/docs/user-guide/labels/#label-selectors) (see below for why you might want a
`Service` without a selector).
